<h1> Extensions </h1>
  <p>Asuming you have WSL and are running WSL (after doing all the building for the cross-compiler), you also need to install the "WSL" extension & "Remote Development" extension in VS-Code.</p>

<h2>Opening in VS-Code (If you installed the project directory on Windows, not WSL)</h2>
<p>Once installed, you need to open the project directory. There should be a new icon, on the side panel (after you've installed the extension(s)).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open the panel, and click on to your WSL machine.</li>
  <li>To reach the project directory and to maneuver to your Windows filesystem, use "/mnt/".</li>
  <li>Then navigate from there....</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't forget to redownload the C/C++ extensions for WSL.</p>
